# Classification of Human Written and Artificial Intelligence Generated Texts

## Introduction
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in natural language processing, has given rise to a critical challenge: distinguishing between texts authored by humans and those generated by AI systems. This README provides an overview of our project aimed at addressing this challenge.

## Problem Statement
### Problem Definition
The project focuses on classifying textual content as either generated by humans or artificial intelligence (AI). Given a set of text samples, our task is to accurately identify their origin using machine learning techniques.

### Motivations
In an era where AI-generated text is increasingly indistinguishable from human-written content, the ability to differentiate sources of text is crucial. Misinformation risks escalate, making it imperative to develop reliable tools for this purpose.

### Justifications
Developing a robust classification model is essential for verifying the authenticity of digital content. This task has significant implications in journalism, academia, and legal matters. Our approach combines Word2Vec and PCA for efficient feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, aiming to enhance detection accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Repository Structure
- **Notebooks**:
  - **Feature Extraction - Human vs LLM:** We utilize Word2Vec embeddings and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract features from the generated data.
  - **Binary Classification Human vs LLM:** This section contains the code for conducting binary classification on the prompts to distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text.
  - **Multi-Class Classification Human vs LLM:** Here, you'll find the code for performing multi-class classification to identify the specific LLM model from which the AI-generated text originates. We consider 5 LLM classes.
  - **Human vs LLM Pipeline:** This section houses our final pipeline, designed to take user input and determine whether the given text is AI-generated or human-written. If it's AI-generated, we provide information about the likely LLM model.
  - **Playground Notebook - Human vs LLM:** Explore our playground notebook for further experimentation and analysis in the context of distinguishing between human and LLM-generated text.
  
- **Environment**:
  Holds the packages used for training, evaluation, and development of our model.
